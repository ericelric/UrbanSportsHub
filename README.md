# Security Flaw in the Urban Sports Club Check-in Process

## Introduction

Urban Sports Club offers a flexible membership that allows users to access a wide range of sports venues across multiple cities. To enter a venue, users must complete a check-in process via the official app. However, the current method of validating check-ins presents a critical security flaw that could be exploited by fraudulent users.

## How the Current Check-in Process Works

1. **User Scans a QR Code**: Upon arriving at a sports venue, the user scans a QR code provided by the venue.
2. **App Validates Membership**: The Urban Sports Club app checks whether the user meets all necessary requirements, including:
   - An active and valid membership
   - Available check-ins for the day
3. **Successful Check-in Confirmation**: If all conditions are met, the app displays a confirmation overlay that signals a successful check-in.
4. **Manual Verification by Staff**: The venue staff visually inspects the check-in confirmation on the userâ€™s device. A valid check-in should include:
   - The memberâ€™s profile picture
   - A green confirmation dialog box
   - A moving circle around the profile picture
   - The name of the class or venue
   - The check-in date and time
   - A time counter since check-in
5. **Entry Granted**: If everything appears correct, the staff allows the user to enter the venue.

## The Security Flaw

The primary issue with this check-in system is that it relies entirely on a **visual verification method**. A fraudulent user could exploit this by using a cloned app that generates a fake check-in overlay identical to the original one. This means:

- The staff at the venue would be unable to differentiate between a legitimate check-in and a fake one.
- Since there is no backend verification on the venueâ€™s side, a fake check-in cannot be detected.
- Fraudulent users could gain unauthorized access without a valid membership.

## Demonstration of the Issue

To highlight this security flaw, I developed a **clone of the Urban Sports Club app** called **Urban Sports Hub**. This app mimics the check-in process and generates an overlay that looks identical to a real check-in screen. While this project was created for educational purposes only, it demonstrates how easily the current system could be bypassed.

## A More Secure Check-in Solution

A better approach to handling check-ins would involve **QR code-based verification by the venue** instead of relying on a visual check. Hereâ€™s how it should work:

1. **User Receives a Unique QR Code**: Instead of displaying a confirmation screen, the app should generate a unique QR code representing the userâ€™s valid membership.
2. **Venue Scans the QR Code**: The venue staff should use a dedicated scanning app or an Urban Sports Club terminal to verify the userâ€™s membership in real-time.
3. **Backend Authentication**: The system should check the userâ€™s membership status, remaining check-ins, and validity directly with Urban Sports Clubâ€™s backend.
4. **Entry Decision**: If the check-in is valid, the system grants access and logs the event securely.

## Conclusion

The current check-in system used by Urban Sports Club is highly vulnerable to fraud due to its reliance on manual visual verification. A more secure solution, where venues scan user-generated QR codes, would ensure that only legitimate check-ins are honored. This change would significantly improve security and prevent unauthorized access, benefiting both the company and its partner venues.
